1.) get an account on OpenShift

2.) Send me whichever email you used to set it up and I can add you to the project.

3.) Install the tools: https://developers.openshift.com/en/managing-client-tools.html (For me, rubygems came installed with ruby, so I skipped that one.)

4.) Run through the "Setting up your machine" section on the same page.
	"rhc setup" is the command

After I have added you to the project (just send me your email you made the account with):

5.) Add your SSH keys to your account. (If you have them on github, just copy and paste, otherwise you will have to generate them. Easy on linux/mac.. not sure how to do it on windows though..)

5.) Checkout the project:
	git clone ssh://55f8a0097628e15a780000a0@dbsystems-engproject.rhcloud.com/~/git/dbsystems.git/

6.) To send your commits to the repo:
	git add --all // to add any files you made
	git commit -m "message here" -a
	git push

7.) To checkout others changes:
	commit your changes first, then:
	git fetch
	git rebase

8.) Visit the site: http://dbsystems-engproject.rhcloud.com/

9.) To look at the log output (fatal errors), you will need to ssh into the project:

	ssh 55f8a0097628e15a780000a0@dbsystems-engproject.rhcloud.com
	cd $OPENSHIFT_LOG_DIR
	vi php.log
