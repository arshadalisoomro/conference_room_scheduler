- Only show time slots that are available (donâ€™t have a reservation currently)
- display reservations in a table
- cancel reservations
- admins and managers need to be able to create users
- admins and managers can view their created users reservations
- we should be able to edit reservations (or is cancelling and making a new one good enough?)
