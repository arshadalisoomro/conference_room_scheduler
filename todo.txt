- see the reservations for users that managers have created
- see all reservations for admins
- recurring reservation support
- only view reservations that are in the future on the table 
- cancel reservations (just send it to a url and make sure confirm before clicking it)
- admins can edit the conference room resources (add, delete, edit their quality)
- create a room viewer page
	- Should just hold more extended info on the rooms (like their resources along with quality)
	- Should have a button at the top or the bottom to "Schedule Meeting" that will simply forward them to the schedule_reservation.php?room_id=xx
